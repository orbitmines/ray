## What is this?, What is OrbitMines?, What are Rays?

This thing is, in essence, a language to understand inconsistencies. A conceptual framework to make sense of ambiguity: A story of how destructively confusing languages can be. Though to me, most importantly, it is here as infrastructure. Infrastructure for the design and implementation of a [different category of (programming) interfaces](https://orbitmines.com/archive/2024-02-orbitmines-as-a-game-project).

A simple way of phrasing this, is that the concept of a **_(hyper-/)_'Vertex', _(hyper-/)_'Edge', _(hyper-/)_'Graph', _(hyper-/)_'Rule', _(hyper-/)_'Tactic', _(hyper-/)_..., _(hyper-/)_'Rewrite'** are merged into one thing: a [Ray](ar.ray/ray.ts/src/ray.ts). It handles surrounding context, ignorances, equivalences, ..., differentiation (And if it cannot, then it offers a way of implementing it for all of the above). 

Though quite importantly, even if those previous words are complete nonsense to you: Either this, or projects following from this, will aid in your understanding. This is the start of a story which will provide infrastructure for communication between all *sciences, (programming) languages, compilers, interfaces, ..., videogames*.

## License Magic

I'm not convinced putting licenses on the repo's in the usual case is anything other than *Minecraft servers putting "Not affiliated with Mojang" in their stores* just because everyone else does it. But here: after doing absolutely no research into the international ramifications: [LICENSE](./LICENSE) a license for those who like to look at them. Try to reason to what that applies in this repository, obviously that doesn't cover everything not made by me or other contributions to OrbitMines or something. Just put a reference to me or this project somewhere if it's remotely interesting to you.
