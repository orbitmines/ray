# Ray: A Universal Language
*One Ray to rule them all, One Ray to find them, One Ray to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.*

## What is this?, What is OrbitMines?, What are Rays?

This thing is, in essence, a programming language, an IDE or a conceptual framework to think about programs. Though to me, most importantly, it is here as infrastructure. Infrastructure for the design and implementation of a [different category of (programming) interfaces](https://orbitmines.com/archive/2024-02-orbitmines-as-a-game-project).

A simple way of phrasing this, is that the concept of a **_(hyper-/)_'Vertex', _(hyper-/)_'Edge', _(hyper-/)_'Graph', _(hyper-/)_'Rule', _(hyper-/)_'Tactic', _(hyper-/)_..., _(hyper-/)_'Rewrite' and similar concepts** are merged into one thing: a [Ray](ar.ray/ray.ray.txt/ray.ray.txt). It handles surrounding context, structure and pattern-matching, defines control-flow and dynamics and acts as a language, theorem prover and rendering engine.

## Where is OrbitMines going with this? - i.e. Future inquiries

Check out everything I've made public regarding this here: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/orbitmines/orbitmines.com/issues) or equivalently, check the Discord channels grouped under the name: [Fractals of the Galaxy](https://discord.com/channels/1055502602365845534/1114584997702156388).

## Local setup
There are several ways of using this programming language.
- Either grab your favorite text editor and get started with [The .ray.txt Programming Language](#the-raytxt-programming-language). Install language support for [IntelliJ] [VS Code] (TODO)
- Download our IDE: [Ether]() (TODO)
- Or go to the [online playground]() (TODO)

## The [`.ray.txt`](ar.ray/ray.ray.txt) Programming Language
Though this project will step away from the limitations of a text file, all programming infrastructure relies on it. A move away from it, will require additional infrastructure (like the IDE and version control). Even if all that is in place, it would still be good if we're able to use existing infrastructure. So ideally we'd like a way to translate the language into a text-based format. Which is where `.ray.txt` comes in.

TODO
```ray.txt

```
