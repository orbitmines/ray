## What is this?

This thing is, in essence, a programming language (Ray), an IDE (Ether) and a conceptual framework to think about programs. Though to me, most importantly, it is here as infrastructure. Infrastructure for the design and implementation of a [different category of (programming) interfaces](https://orbitmines.com/archive/2024-02-orbitmines-as-a-game-project).

*It handles surrounding context, structure and pattern-matching, defines control-flow and dynamics and acts as a programming language, theorem prover, version control system, database and rendering engine.*

## Local setup
There are several ways of using this programming language.
- Download our IDE: [Ether]() (TODO)
- Go to the [online playground](https://ether.orbitmines.com) (TODO)

- Or download manually
  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:orbitmines/ray.git
  ```

  ```shell
  cd ray && ./install.sh
  ```
  
  ```shell
  ether
  ```
  
- Using other IDEs
    - Grab your favorite text editor and get started with [The .ray.txt Programming Language](#the-raytxt-programming-language). Install language support for [IntelliJ] [VS Code] (TODO)

## The [`.ray.txt`](ar.ray/ray.ray.txt) Programming Language
Though this project will step away from the limitations of a text file, all programming infrastructure relies on it. A move away from it, will require additional infrastructure (like the IDE and version control). Even if all that is in place, it would still be good if we're able to use existing infrastructure. So ideally we'd like a way to translate the language into a text-based format. Which is where `.ray.txt` comes in.

TODO
```ray.txt

```
