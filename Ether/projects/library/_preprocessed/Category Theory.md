###### "Different Infinities"
In mathematics or other ways of phrasing it, there's then the concept of bigger, ..., different infinities. Which one could merely rephrase as infinities, or looped continuations, with additional structure defined which has more of those looped continuations.

- [ ] Difference between on the Frame/not on the frame.
- [ ] Omega/Aleph infinity counting, Transfinite
- [ ] Uncountable?
- [ ] More novel/non-trivial calculi, where these show up at other places. (Pi-calculus or other things?) - Just anything which could have some loop defined.

Like in the [[Society for Multidisciplinary and Fundamental Research (SEMF)]] livestream; "absolute equality as a concept", ignoring/.../forgetting you just did that.

infinity groupoids which break the recursion of the stack

Free category / transitive closure, basically would mean that all the initial/terminal rays are equivalenced - (no distinction / or just interpreted the same) . Or just in one step one can be anywhere.

### Homotopy/Homoiconic
Garphical homoiconicity/homotopy, yhe abstract lattern is there, but fits a general nymber of different ways in which it can be demonstrated graphically, in that direction it's different. Homoiconic in the abstract

---

[[Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)|Homotopy]] if there's nothing in between in some space (so on some other level of description), collapse to one point. In this interpretation how to differentiate between the levels of descriptions (directuonalitirsa) whoch to collaps, which to preserve

Can this structure be provably the simplest to (can even be proven?) describe and have [[Homoiconicity]] through ignorances

---

If some underlying level of description doesn't match the relations at the other level of description we're using for equivalencies / hence homotopies. Then don't permit the invariance/variance and force no difference. Hence any equivalencr necessarily implies possible homotopies. Whether those spaces can actually be differentiated between to create infinite continuous differences between those points ss enumeration of possible homotopies isn't necessarily that obvious in the embedded space ; the underlying level of description  

---

Yes, category thepry equivalency frames ( circularly? - perhaps that is also a form of indirection or at least from a certain perspective without additional identifiability)

---

Structure preserving permutation - automorphism (this just means some directionality (could be arbitrarily superposed/structured itself?))

---

Homotopy move from variance to some variance, only if 'nothing in between' -> at any level of description which is deemed relevant for that homotopical transformation. - SOme some triangular circle over some other underlying structures which defines some directionality/spaciality in between. - It's details dont need to be defined to be limiting, it just needs to be there.

---

Functionality of x means if I apply a composition of morphisms it's the same as applying a morphism.

Topos/Topoid might be incredibly relevant - allows one to talk about parts of some object in category theory (in the sense that they're morphisms). - Has quite some similarities. - Something to do with bottom/topology - quite relevant

Grouping these concepts

- [ ] Superposition if two directionalities cross more than once?
  - What about a frame which has a superposition at initial/terminal/frame/
Initial/terminal domain/codomain (co, again, the dual...)

---

- [ ] 'Is accessible/nonaccessible' generalizable to the frame and directoinality?

- Temporal history of usages replacing testing/changes made in functionality assuming the memory capacicity is consistent in some nontrivial way./ (alluding to the directinoality of ignorant morphisms in a category)

- [ ] direction on intial & each terminal as both continuation and reference to instantiation at all the extremes

- Opposite dual / Initial/terminal? / Needs a direction in which the opposite

- [ ] How to make this idea more clear of ignorantly selecting the frame/node. In order to equivalate them, the direction needs to be present. (Now this doesn't necessarily need to be directly accessilbe at any level of description, but the direction which would turn into that if explored (as a temporal direction, needs to be there))


; supersymmetry z2 gradiant

Now this more theoretical statement will possibly initially either sound contradictory, but I hope as I keep explaining it will start making more sense. And the insight for this was for me a critical realization of finding the interpretations I'll dive to now.

- Vertex necessarily intersect with some hyperedge (which defines the frame/node)

; functions/morphisms/arrows/

- [[Bigraph]] (https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~michele/bigrapher.html) / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisimulation

- [ ] Annihilation/Creation (link to [[ZX-Calculus]]?)?

- [ ] Generalization of time/space/multiway complexity in terms of frames and certain compilations as ignorant connections between structures.
- [ ] Actually need further structure at the points defined inorder to define the more specific types, so we restrict the ideas of only abstractly 'morphing' equivalencing the entire thign. (So a partial (equivalency on two/n more parts of some arbitrary structure))
- [ ] Intuitit boundary of boundary

- [ ] Some key to define additional frames and complexity at the points (say something to add additional binary relations (nonlinking) or some arbitreary defined complexity while exploring the graphs)
- [ ] Define branchial (abstracting level) / & volitions merely as another hyperedge (of arbitrary complexity) through some other initial space
- [ ] How to display the transition between the two visually is there a good way to transition there?

- [ ] Perhaps I'd need a better way of realizing the inconsistencies/ignorances & snapping of connections (by probably moving some other points to them.) ; What happens structurally when one removes one of the conenctions which make up a part of the hyperedge, leaving a frame without any definition of it, and thus leaving a binary relation there, or does that reation itself need to be destroyed as well (could probably see taht then one would lose the temporal information there. (But we could encode that information within the observing systems which has access to that history which the modelling is ignorant of))

- [ ] Phrase this ideas of having to specify additional directionalities as the constraints in a certain philosophical way that as an abstract pattern, always, at any frame which satisfies the additional dimensionalities already introduced, any additional ones which do not interfere with the structure could in some sense be used there, though the abstraction not having access to them may be relevant and might result in certain things to be inconsistent in this way.
  - Just the same idea of quantum mechanics.

; borimium links (biology networks)

; commutative diagram

; groupoid (all isomorphisms)
; devierts from groupoids ; morphism/isomoprhism are generealizing the idea of reversibility, ; similar to ignorances of node references.
Anti chain different between the grouping/selection/hyperedge over the structure underneath

unital; (need halt state for unity object ;)

Coborism, just another equivalency, another frame equivalency? No difference again? (Just the types of relationship one is equivalencing)

functor/ignorant time step is like some equivalency preserving structures, but the different is forgotten (abstractly)

- Infinity groupoids ; and other infinities? ; My guess would be that their definition might lie on the initial/terminal sides of this definition, since I'm guessing that infinity/generalization as a concept are best interpreted as a direction?

Multiway / monoidal ; quite obvisou why / splutting of, hence tensor products (combinartory explosions)


Take some dual, reference one part of it at the frame as enumartion which defines the other side of the dual.

- [ ] How to conceptualize the selection or collapsing of a binary superposition (assuming the model itself is phrased as I currently conceptualize it), describing some other system. (Is it merely as simple as shrinking the frame by one)

; The moving to the frame of some hyperedge seems to be the same as coarse-graining, somewhat intuitively. - You know how many connections are there, not where in the sequence/position that is the frame.

; Infinite dimensionality on the frame perhaps its realized looping?

; operator ; function, complex number binary linear

; Branchial graphs being some frame defined on an initial/terminal frame?

holographic principle from infinity-1-topos?

alpha equivalence / up to isomorphism / same idea..
; [[Jonathan Gorard]] mentioned some 'not saying equal' in category theory ; and mentioned some non-exiistence of an n- (probably generailized ) variant of this - which this conceptualization might be.

- [ ] What makes certain element higher orders of abstraction, is having detail/information of additional structures mapping on the points, which are ignorant (possibly?) of those lower levels, but which one accesses, since they're not ignorant from the level of constructing the abstractions.

- [ ] How to prevent the intuition of wanting to write a new programming language to solve the problem translate to mathematics/category theory ... Is it necessary cross compiling, is it necessary implementing the ideas? How to prevent the thing many people think would solve it but merely relocates the problem?

- [ ] Product is the frame, addition in the direction in which the frames are defined ; hence orthogonal. ; Phrase (non-)commutativity as different structures in some frame/directionality too.

- [ ] How to define the assumption that some ill-defined directionality will end up at some point (assume it ends up at some point) without specifying that in between. -> Probably just as simple as equivalating it on another level of description. Is there any way to this at the level of the description that defines the ill-defined function?

- [ ] What is the significance of having both the initial/terminal side and the middle frame be equated on the same frame?
  - [ ] Does a concept like this exist in Category theory? (Some point being both the morphism & object perhaps?)
  - [ ] Is this perhaps close to what might usually confuse humans in many scenarios? ; Equating direction for some point along that direction, equating some extreme/direction as some actual point ; etc... ; Initial thoughts on this might be that its incredibly significant.

- [ ] Follow the entire directionality as an ignorant rewrite moving some pointer across the directionality;?? Or what else would this be?

- [ ] Difference between initial both being referenecd bu the intital use of the function as opposed to merely connecting initial/terminal ends, perhaps the difference being the context in the caudal history being relevant/different in some way

- [ ] Superpositions at initial/terminal ends of the frame, how interpreted? And can the same be said (probably inconsistently) about some selected frame. / Probably a better idea to remove the framing of the word 'frame' as the middle one, and use something else.

- [ ] Perhaps uncertainty phrased as, assuming that between any time-step I'm defining, arbitrary changes can happen to the graph and that timestep. ; This brakes usual assumptions of associativity ; in which you could specify the assumption of associativity, necessarily requires a form of consistency.

- [ ] I can define forall as a looping directionality which becomes a pattern of enumerating some structure (the thing matching each element), but this doesn't necessarily uniquely define the forall, but it will match it, in the sense of something like a specific one matching with a looping directionality defined, will match it, but doesn't actually have for all. What additional constraint would say something opf "each different, could be exhaustive and either terminal or further enumeration (superposition at the terminal end), but again how a constraint on all possibilities?"

- [ ] How to phrase contravariant?/Profunctor In the sense of having no reversibility (generally), and not being able to match the initial side to some other initial side at the ignorant point/frame. ; Abstractly you can already represent this, so having that possibility already there isn't the issue, its some other constraints which are not kept here, probably in the sense of equating all the steps of the functions as next time steps and only outgoing arrows is next? ; Yes, it's about flowing in one direction (can of course split of into superpositions), and having at my terminal end the definition of the next step (which in category theory is some looping identity/some next step).

- [ ] One gets (using [[Jonathan Gorard]]'s naming of this concept) covariant computation, "out of the box" with this abstraction. - I told him I was thinking similarly at [[Society for Multidisciplinary and Fundamental Research (SEMF)]] after his 3rd lecture. - What was the first time I realized it could be used this way?

## Category Theory

- [ ] Discrete category - "No structure, only points" - Or: no positional/structural encodings between the points (frames), but the points themselves necessarily hold some structure we might be ignoring (abstractly): no structure only from a particular perspective. (; in between the points we're describing ignoring the space in which we talk about them (abstractly))

Essence of category theory
- [Category]()
  - [ ] The morphisms in a category perhaps best defined as having their initial/terminal ends of directionalities equivalent? Since it's representing after each time step go in any other direction defined at the frame. ?
- [Functor]()
  - Are algebratic data types 
    - ; Merely equivalencies over a more complex structure which conceptually necessitates the description of a language. ; Category theory differentiates between mapping/functorality, probably by assuming some different between compilation of function/mapping
    - Functor modifies content of the container (directionality) ; the frames defined at the objects (middle frames). It never modifies the structure (the directionality that defines what the container is). ; This is of course modifying the content since it changes the structure. ; But not by the seperated definition in which Milewski uses the concept here in (9.1). (The structure here being ignored by the definition of the frames)
- [Natural transformation]()
  - Is a morphism of which the described categories are ignorant of (so just some directionality on parts of the category, which are ignorant of this directionality.) 
  - Polymorphic ADT -> ADT = is a natural transformation.
  - Polymorphic functions ; a lot are natural transformations (Not contravariant? ; Not partially contravariant (mixed))
  - Natural transformation modifies the structure of the container (the container/directionality.) ; The initial/terminal ends of the ray. (Hence, intuitively like Milewski said, orthogonal). - Not allowed to modify the content (other than the abstract directionality that is the structure). - Cannot create - Can remove. (which is not connecting it to anything else?) - Cannot modify. (The structure here being ignored by the definintion of the frames)
  - Natural isomorphisms (isomorphic transformation) between Homsets (Homomorphisms) are called Adjunctions.

- Pullback is - f on fst element is the same as g on the snd element (A.x = B.y)
  - Pullback/pushback ; cospan/span

- Difference between 2-category and bicategory (2-category up to isomorphism?) ; is that the one is ignorant and the other is not. (Coherence checking introduced here ; similar to me already defining it to correspond to the same binary, not any binary)

- [Homomorphism]
  - Preserves some structure

- [Dual]()
    - Initial/Terminal side as category/categoryOP? Either at the frame or at the extremes of the direction.
    - If Initial/Terminal side on the saeme frame then: "Self-dual"
        - [Self-dual]()
            - https://books.google.com/books?id=iXh6rOd7of0C&pg=PA62 ?
    - [ ] How to conceptualize the reversal/opposite/reversing of time arrows. Perhaps not necessarily in the structure of the graph (though you could), but you could also do it at the level of the hyperedge which connects the initial and terminal extremes as an equivalency (at least in the case of a self-dual)

Some possibly similar phrasings of the "initial/terminal" side (dual category might be important here as well):  Domain/codomain, source/target, left/right, frontend/backend
- Some obvious 'opposite extreme'

    - Hom-set is perhaps the frame defined at the initial side of some directionality? Conceptualized as "The pattern which matches all initial sides (function defining) frames which describes the reset of the structure ; e.g. Any morphism which describes this directionality would match here." ; Hom-set/Hom-class is not required to be a set.
        - When I have a specific implementation of a function and I understand its internal workings this would be categorized as additional dimensionalities on the initial frame.
        - How to differentiate between there is some function which describes this, and all functions which describe this? (; Perhaps some enumeration/infinity/loop defined at the frame which describes some enumeration (which does not necessarily need to be defined (can be ignorant)) ; basically the abstract variant of the mode which actually enumerates possible functions (what to do in the partial case here as well, where only a number of examples are given), ... etc. similar type of issues which need similar solutions in partiality)
        - What's the `category/set theoretical` phrasing of making a distinction between some morphism compared to all morphisms between some X and Y. Is it merely defined as some non-defined enumerator of possible morphisms?
            - This would merely ened to be some pattern of what the function does, so already the mapping in the form of the direction between the two frames. and something which enumerations the functions, so a loop one direction above. --> This might actually work. Still need to differentiate between that direction which says that it links back to this particular instance of fucntion (e.g. initial side), and not just something which matches.
                - This distinction is probably incredibly important. Maybe the construction of the difference between the frame and the selected direction might make this distinction??/
