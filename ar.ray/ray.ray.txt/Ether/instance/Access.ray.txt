  //   - Reading/Writing to locations which are explicitly set to something other than "public" like "default_privacy_policy" -> It's set as confidential.write.
  //   - Reading/Writing to Player.instance.private (Whether an instance is considered a privately-hosted one)
  //   - Reading "local"/"private" private encryption keys.
  //   - Writing to existing "local"/"private" private&public encryption keys. (You can write to new ones though)
  // Otherwise you can use/create policies like "private" & "managed" to indicate you only want to allow access to
  // your own managed servers which have access to the player. Or more creative things like being close to a player in a world.
