- For things like an interface, .next but a .move updates the whole location (which could be a graph like a 2d visual field, tilted by some yaw/pitch)

// For strreaming, a player has a particular location which is the streaming location , that is being broadcast.
// TODO So watching a stream is simply following that location.

// Networking
- Managed items by another instance (mirrors)

// Quests
Infinite maps etc..
- Like path to asynchronously
We could have equivalence graphs which are infinitely generating, how would we deal with a simple check then?
- Quests: Loading partially (in/out-of-order) + reading from disk

// Writing compiler optimizations
// dead code after return if there's no goto to a label there.

// Transactions & dynamically

// Language features
- -- / space false, true .map(!)
- ~~
Like '--', the operator '~~', wraps around an entire
array = [1, 2, 3]
array ~~ .[1] = 'B' // returns [1, 'B', C]

   (0 -> +1){< 10}.for i
   0{< 10}.for i // Since numbers are by default equipped with the numberline, and 0 is not real, but the Decimal.Positive.


confidential.read none.write mac_address: Binary.Positive{length == 48} =
  secure Binary.Positive{length == 47}.random ~~ .[6].push_after(1)



// Maybe
Patterns like 2d expand with .., in the IDE. (And other graphs)
a, ..b, ..c, d (ambiguity so superpose -> but how are keypairs matched b,c &/| information which depends on other info)
