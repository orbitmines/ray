// Location
- Locations differ slightly from traditional file systems:
  - There can be many items (files) defined at a single location.
  - Any location is both a directory and a file; it defines both values and a (hierarchical) structure.

// Networking
- All networking is abstracted away
- Importing external libraries/packages
- Quests: Loading partially (in/out-of-order) + reading from disk
- Managed items by another instance (mirrors)
