You want = to be called on object, changing the type possibly. Since it's on a variable - variable is some object. So that would mean that = without effecting the current value, would first have to copy it over to another place.

.random on graph/array to fill with random possible values, you want a .length or .count to be there. or .edgecount to limit it somehow. Or infinitely randomly generating for array for instance. Or some parameter probability on the length of the thing. But in the graph case there'd need to be that parameter of probability of how big it'd be, otherwise each edgecount would be infonitely generating.
So some way of saying .random with a 50% change at each bit to stop generating larger ones. Or (20% etc.) What's the math on average/usual length based on thay probability

// How is return defined? It goes to a program which could have a chain of other operations defined on it. a.b.c.d, a is hit a return? then .b

// "run at compile time" ; constexpr ; when can this be inferred?

// Matching a looped String until some lookahead function is matched -> It's just that the order of the .OR is first checking the lookahead, then the loop.

// An evaluator, which can be possibly infinite function length, which doesn't define methods out-of-order.

// instance_of needs to somehow give access to a partially matched type. And things like dynamically assert shouldn't throw directly, but check all conditions and report them all together.

// Some generic way of populating all objects with an object id, so that equality then has to check that, but dont do this by default.

// TODO What is inheritance if two array types are extended say. 'Decimal.Positive' / 'Binary', is it an AND, or OR?

// Define 'return' as a goto?

// Object{} is like Object.filter()

// Array.some parameterless = is it non-empty?

// Type loop

// Refinement changes the type of a method, so that should be allowed, how?

// A Node has a definition (which is possibly in sequence) => which is the program that generated it. And successive methods called on it for it to become what it did.
//    -> Node definition and history coincide: You want all the updates up to some place, and access that as a Node.


// As a rewrite rule on program: -> variable = node; def actual_variable variable.history.last end; def actual_variable=(value) variable.history.push_back(value) end

// Should None define '=' with memory of where it came from, instead of doing `*`=. This way you say Obj.Subclass = '', calls Subclass.=, which sets definer[name] = ''
// Setting the current value '= expression'
// `*`(`*`=) returns `*`=.

//TODO How to get `*`, to still be able to use methods on the object, without recursively calling itself.

// (args: ...) = var.()[args] // var.() to distinguish it from var(). So when () is called, .() is called on `*`.
